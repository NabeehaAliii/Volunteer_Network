## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the frontend application on your local machine.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NabeehaAliii/Volunteer_Network.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the frontend directory:**

   ```bash
   cd Volunteer_Network/react-app
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   Using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Or using yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the development server:**

   Using npm:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   Or using yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

2. **Access the application:**

   Open your browser and navigate to:

   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

   The application should now be running locally.

### Building for Production

To build the application for production, run:

Using npm:

```bash
npm run build
```

Or using yarn:

```bash
yarn build
```

This will create an optimized production build in the `build` folder.

## Environment Variables

The application uses environment variables to manage configuration settings. Create a `.env` file in the `react-app` directory and add the following variables:

```env
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001/api
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=your_stripe_public_key
# Add any other necessary variables
```

**Note:** Never commit your `.env` file to version control. Make sure it's included in your `.gitignore` file.

---

## API Endpoints

The frontend communicates with the backend through various API endpoints. Here are some of the key endpoints used:

- **Authentication**
  - `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
  - `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
  - `POST /api/auth/logout` - User logout

- **Opportunities**
  - `GET /api/opportunities` - Get all opportunities
  - `GET /api/opportunities/:id` - Get opportunity by ID
  - `POST /api/opportunities` - Create new opportunity
  - `PUT /api/opportunities/:id` - Update opportunity
  - `DELETE /api/opportunities/:id` - Delete opportunity

- **Organizations**
  - `GET /api/organizations` - Get all organizations
  - `GET /api/organizations/:id` - Get organization by ID
  - `POST /api/organizations` - Create new organization
  - `PUT /api/organizations/:id` - Update organization
  - `DELETE /api/organizations/:id` - Delete organization

- **Donations**
  - `GET /api/donations` - Get all donations
  - `POST /api/donations` - Create new donation

**Note:** Ensure that the backend server is running and the API base URL is correctly set in your `.env` file.
